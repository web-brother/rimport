		<p class="opening">RIMPORT INDUSTRIES, INC., was organized on February 15, 1990 primarily to cater to a lucrative and popular business in Video Cassette tapes rental. However, its business adventure did not last long in the rental business. It was short-lived.</p>
		<p>There was a Raytheon Marine Company which was around selling Naval Radars to the Phil. Navy. It had a problem getting into the Philippine Navy, the only market for Raytheon’s large naval radars, navaids, and radio communication equipments.</p>
		<p>Soon enough, Raytheon Marine Company appointed RIMPORT  ENTERPRISES, the forerunner of RIMPORT INDUSTRIES, INC.,  as  the sole authorized distributor of Raytheon Marine Company in the Philippines. RAYTHEON COMPANY was and is one of the five (5) biggest and efficiently managed companies in the U.S.A.</p>
		<p>RIMPORT had successfully pursued the proposed project of Raytheon Marine Company with the Philippine Navy, the first ever, for the Supply and Installation of Radar Simulator System at the Naval Training Command at PN Cavite, Philippines, which was funded through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Program of the joint U.S. Military Assistance Group (JUMAG) which cost in Philippine Peso, P25M in 1991.</p>
		<p>Another  FMS project  with the Navy, which was instrumentally pursued by RIMPORT for Raytheon, was the Retrofitting or Refurbishment of eight (8) Naval Patrol Escort Crafts radars. This project which involved  the Supply and Installation by Raytheon of big naval radars  (AN/SPS-64 Series) through FMS was in the vicinity of $640,000.00 in 1992.</p>
		<p>Within this period, RIMPORT had maintained a complete office facility and 0ne-man crew to sustain its operation, to support its sales documentation services, follow-up FMS   papers at JUSMAG and other AFP establishments in the pursuit of establishing its name in the military business field. A fax machine, a personal computer, and an electric typewriter were the office furnishings made available for this decent but infant operation.</p>
		<p>The time had come for RIMPORT to expand. Big Navy projects were promising. On February 16, 1991, it had assumed its role as an active business concern, employed an Office Manager/Administrator and Marine Sales Manager who took care of the maritime product market, both in sales and services, the Industrial Sales Manager who did nothing but promoted and sold Strand Lighting Stage and Theatrical Dimmers, Controls and Luminaires, the General Service Supervisor who looked after the interests of the company in its after-sales-service support and annual maintenance contracts with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, Folk Arts Theater, Mandarin Oriental Manila Hotel and those which have been using Strand Stage/Theatrical and Architectural Lighting Dimmers and Controls.</p>
		<p>Along with its expansion, came the decision of ENGR. REY G. IMPORTANTE, ECE/MBA,  to resign as Managing Director of RACOMSER, INC., and assumed as Chairman and President of RIMPORT. Supporting Engr. Importante were two Sales Managers and Service Engineers who have specialized in architectural lighting dimmers and controls and in TV broadcasting studio dimmers, controls, luminaires, maritime and naval products.</p>
		<p>In a span of two (2) months, the company engaged the services of two (2) electronics technicians who were trained to undertake the repairs of different electronics and communications equipment on board ships, both for ocean-going and domestic shipping. When the after-sales-service supports have been established, the marketing of commercial and naval navigational aids have been actively pursued.</p>
		<p>However, the main thrust has always been anchored in general trading, repairing and servicing. The promotion and marketing of naval, navigational aids and the stage, theatrical, hotels and TV broadcasting studio dimmers, controls and luminaires became the day-to-day activities. These activities were/are supported by our suppliers; Raytheon Marine Company, U.S.A. for marine electronics and communications and Strand Lighting Asia Ltd., U.K. USA, Italy, H.K. for lighting dimmers, controls and luminaires.</p>
		<p>The repair servicing instruments that we use in our daily maintenance and repair activities like Tektronic Oscilloscope, Digital Frequency meters, multi-testers, watt meters, and other related test instruments and tools are of the latest state-of-the-art in  electronics equipment servicing.</p>
		<p>We keep a sizeable amount of spare parts inventory to support these repair  servicing activities. A big volume of dimmers and controls, luminaires, bulbs and marine equipment spare parts are maintained to keep them ready to support the annual maintenance and repair service contracts.</p>
		<p>The Company has been establishing excellent business relationship with its customers by way of providing technical and operational training to their engineers or operators, RIMPORT supports the training of the customers’ engineers or operators to the factory of Strand Lighting Asia LTD. For the purpose of enhancing their skills in the maintenance and operation of STRAND   equipment, the customers own.</p>
